**Anti-Vuvuzela Filter** is an open-source project dedicated to **second-order analog filters** and beyond. This project was initially developed to design an **“anti-vuvuzela” filter**, aiming to attenuate the distinctive and persistent sound of vuvuzelas while preserving the clarity of commentators' voices during the **2010 FIFA World Cup**.

## 🎯 Purpose

- 🔇 **Targeted Noise Reduction**: Specifically designed to **attenuate vuvuzela noise** while maintaining the intelligibility of speech.
- 🎚 **Second-Order Analog Filtering**: Utilizing advanced filtering techniques for efficient noise cancellation.
- 🛠️ **Open-source and Customizable**: Modify and adapt the design for other audio filtering applications.
