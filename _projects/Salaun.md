Salaun is a third-person narrative game developed in Unity C#. Created through self-learning during my high school years (specifically in 2018), this project represents my first concrete experience in software development. The player takes on the role of a young Breton who has just finished his studies and sets out to explore the world around him through interactions with various NPCs.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 🏗️ **Narrative Experience**: Immerse the player in a captivating story.
- 🕹️ **Exploration**: Encourage exploration and interaction with the environment.
- 🎨 **Unique Aesthetic**: A Low-Poly visual style inspired by the famous game "Unturned".

## 📝 Features

- 🎭 **Low-Poly Graphics**: A cubic style reminiscent of "Unturned".
- 💬 **Dialogue System**: Numerous conversations with NPCs to enrich the story.
- 🌍 **Interactive World**: Explore a universe filled with different characters and secrets to uncover.
