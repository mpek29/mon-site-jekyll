**StateMachineSafe** is a project aimed at designing and simulating a state machine to manage the opening and closing of a safe. This machine is built using D flip-flops and logic gates, ensuring precise logical control of the mechanism.

## 🎯 Purpose

- 📜 **State Machine Design**: Development of a state graph defining the safe's behavior.
- 🧮 **Transition Table and Karnaugh Map**: Derivation of logical equations necessary for system operation.
- 🔬 **LTSpice Simulation**: Verification and validation of the logical circuit through LTSpice simulation.
- 🔑 **Secure Access Management**: Implementation of a reliable mechanism ensuring the safe's opening and closing according to a defined sequence.
