**IndustrialMixingSystemAutomation** is a project aimed at automating a basic industrial mixing system using a Schneider Electric Programmable Logic Controller (PLC). The project integrates a supervision system to enable remote monitoring, parameter adjustments, and alarm management, ensuring improved control and operational efficiency.

## 🎯 Purpose

- 🖥️ **Supervision System Integration**: Enable remote access to machine data, control cycle starts, and adjust key parameters.
- 🔔 **Alarm Management**: Implement an alert system that logs faults and issues for better maintenance tracking.
- 🎛️ **Human-Machine Interface (HMI) Evolution**: Enhance the HMI while maintaining seamless interaction with the supervision system.
- ⚙️ **Process Prioritization**: Ensure that parallel control mechanisms do not interfere with each other by implementing a priority-based management system.
