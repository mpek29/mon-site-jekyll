**Burgman650-Simulation** is an open-source project focused on the **modeling, simulation, and testing** of the **Suzuki Burgman 650 scooter**. This project involves studying the **assembly drawings** of each system component, creating **functional models**, and simulating their interactions using **Xcos on Scilab**. The final step includes analyzing the simulation results to verify alignment with the manufacturer's claimed performance.  

## 🎯 Purpose

- 📜 **System study**: Analyzing the overall assembly and subsystems of the scooter.
- 🔄 **Simulation of interactions**: Ensuring seamless operation between different subsystems.
- 🏁 **Performance validation**: Comparing simulation results with Suzuki’s specifications.
