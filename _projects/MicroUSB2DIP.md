This is an open-source reverse-engineered version of a Micro USB to DIP adapter, based on the original component available [here](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/32947889760.html). The goal of this project was to practice reverse engineering as a learning exercise and to prepare for a future adaptation in a larger project.

## 🎯 Purpose
- 🔍 **Reverse engineering**: Understanding the design and functionality of this micro USB  to DIP connector.
- 🛠️ **Skill development**: Enhancing expertise in PCB design and hardware analysis skills.
- 🔄 **Future adaptation**: Leveraging this knowledge for embedded applications.
