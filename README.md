🎓 I’m Florian Pasco, a Master’s student in Engineering specializing in Electronics, Computer Science, and Mechatronics, currently training at the Brest National School of Engineering in France.

👨‍💻 I am passionate about designing and sharing open-source projects that are reusable and easy to understand. My portfolio is a collection of projects I’ve worked on—either alone or with colleagues—showcasing my skills in electronics, programming, and mechanics. It also provides direct access to related resources such as GitHub repositories and technical documentation.

🔧 Recently, I developed a full-stack project using React, Next.js, Django, Python, and PostgreSQL, demonstrating my expertise in modern web and backend development. I also have experience in reverse engineering, having successfully diagnosed and repaired 20+ electronic units. Additionally, I designed a thermal resistance control board with real-time sensor feedback for precise temperature regulation.

📚 Outside of engineering, I enjoy self-training, personal development, and learning from research materials, particularly from the French Polar Institute. I also like to improve my skills through hands-on experiences, whether it’s repairing objects or exploring new fields of knowledge.

⛺ I love traveling and discovering new places—whether it’s hiking, biking, or setting off on expeditions in my car. I also enjoy participating in social activities and associations, always eager to explore and grow.

🚀 Feel free to check out my portfolio and explore my projects!
