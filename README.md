Welcome to My Portfolio

Hello! My name is Florian Pasco, and I’m a Master’s student in Engineering specializing in Electronics, Computer Science, and Mechatronics at the Brest National School of Engineering in France.

I am passionate about technology, innovation, and problem-solving. Throughout my studies and personal projects, I have developed expertise in electronics, programming, and mechanics, working on a wide range of technical challenges. My portfolio showcases the projects I’ve undertaken—either individually or collaboratively—highlighting my skills in embedded systems, web development, and reverse engineering.

💡 What I Do:

    Develop open-source projects that are reusable, well-documented, and easy to understand.
    Build full-stack applications using React, Next.js, Django, Python, and PostgreSQL.
    Work on hardware design and reverse engineering, having successfully diagnosed and repaired 20+ electronic units.
    Create control systems, such as a thermal resistance control board with sensor feedback for precise temperature regulation.

Beyond technology, I am constantly learning through self-training, personal development, and research—particularly from the French Polar Institute. I also enjoy repairing objects, engaging in social activities, and taking part in various associations.

🌍 Outside of Engineering:
I love to travel and explore, whether it’s hiking, biking, or embarking on road trips in my car. I'm always eager to discover new places, gain new experiences, and push my limits.
