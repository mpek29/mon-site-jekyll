Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="29px" height="29px">


🎓 I'm Florian Pasco, a **Master’s student in Engineering** specializing in **Electronics, Computer Science, and Mechatronics**.  

👨‍💻 I am passionate about creating and sharing **open-source projects** that are reusable and easy to understand, helping others grow in the fields of **electronics, programming, and mechanics**.  

🔧 Recently, I developed a **full-stack project** using **React, Next.js, Django, Python, and PostgreSQL**, showcasing my skills in modern web and backend development.  

📚 Beyond technology, I enjoy **self-training**, exploring **personal development**, and learning from resources like the **French Polar Institute**.  

⛺ I love traveling and discovering new places—whether it's **hiking**, **biking**, or going on **road trips in my car**!  

🎯 I’ve also applied my skills in **reverse engineering**, successfully diagnosing and repairing **20+ electronic units**. Additionally, I designed and worked on a **thermal resistance control board** with feedback from a thermal resistance sensor for precise regulation.
